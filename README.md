# COL106_Data_Structures_Algorithms
This repository contains the data structures and algorithms I designed while pursuing the course [COL106 : Data Structure and Algorithms](http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~bagchi/courses/COL106_18-19/).

Most of the content is inspired from the course.

I implemented these data structures both in **Python** and **Java**.

Data structures implemented:
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Priority Queues and Heaps
  - Skip-Lists
  - Trees (Binary)
  - Binary Search Trees
  - AVL Trees

Algorithms implemented:
  - *Sorting Algorithms*
     - Selection Sort
     - Insertion Sort
     - Bubble Sort
     - Merge Sort
     - Heap Sort (Implemented in Heaps)
     - Quick Sort
     - Counting Sort/Bucket Sort
     - Radix Sort
